## Screen Shots
## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
```
$ gem install cocoapods
```
> CocoaPods 1.1.0+ is required to build CareemMoviesBox.

### CocoaPods configuration

You just need to run the following command:
```
$ pod install
```

## Architecture
The current architecture of the app is MVP (Model View Presenter).

The most important components are as follow:

1. `MoviesListViewController` â€“ View controller class which acts as the application main view controller. Provides a container for application view controllers. Conforms to `MoviesListViewProtocol` which provides the needed information about the service response.
2. `MoviesListPresenter` - Presenter class conforming to `MoviesListProtocol`  and handles all the logic operations of the movies list view.
3. `AppServiceManager` â€“ It represents the abstract layer that interfaces directly with the network third parties and handles all the request through a generic API called `doRequest(_:)`  - please use it wisely.
4. `SearchManager` - Class that manages all the search requests and parses the returned response to the corresponding model.
5. `MoviesListConstants` - Class that contains all the magic values in the app
6. `TableShowMode` â€“ Table view showing mode enum. If you want to customize the table cell appearance based on set of options like **Loading** show the loading cell for example or the default loader, **Error** show error cell as a placeholder or **Normal** show the default cells.
